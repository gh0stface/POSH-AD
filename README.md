# POSH-AD

A repo of multiple PowerShell Scripts that can be used against Active Directory.

This GitHub repository is filled with individual PowerShell scripts that can be run against Active Directory for various tasks. There was a time that Quest Active Directory CMDlets (QAD) made working with Active Directory extremely streamlined and fast. These CMDlets are no longer under a GNU license and you must purchase this. 

The goal of this repo is to provide canned scripts that can be used by sysadmins, engineers, analysts, etc. in order to be efficient and effective with PowerShell while working with Active Directory.

All scripts will be using the basic Active Directory schema, therefore should be able to be leveraged in any environment. Simply modify only what is needed in order to run in your environment.
