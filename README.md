# POSH-AD

A repo of multiple PowerShell Scripts that can be used against Active Directory.

This GitHub repository is filled with individual PowerShell scripts that can be run against Active Directory for various tasks. There was a time that Quest Active Directory CMDlets (QAD) existed for free whch made working with Active Directory streamlined and fast. These CMDlets are no longer under a GNU license and you must purchase this. 

The goal of this repo is to provide canned scripts that can be used by sysadmins, engineers, analysts, etc. in order to be efficient and effective with PowerShell while working with Active Directory.

Many scripts are created from the mindeset of an engineer/anaylst that is working specifically within the Identity and Access Management space. Scripts will span from creating security groups, gathering group membership, or as simple as getting identity information on an account.

All scripts are written under the assumption that the default Active Directory schema included with Windows Server 2012 and on is used. Simply modify only what is needed in order to run in your environment.

There will be some scripts not geared towards AD alone, but rather useful within a windows operating environment.
